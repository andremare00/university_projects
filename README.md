Here I include the code of few empirical analyses on real-world data carried out during my University studies.

- invalsi.do -
The purpose of the analysis was to study the relationship between test scores and class size.
It contains the code of a cross-section regression analysis performed on microdata about 10th-grade Italian students.
Data cannot be published due to license concerns.

- wlb.do -
The purpose was to study the relationship between labour productivity and work-life balance.
It contains the code of a PCA and a panel regression analysis performed at the EU country level in the time span 2014-2019.
Although I haven't published the dataset here, the Do-file includes the list of the variables used and their source.

- SA on Amazon's reviews.R -
The purpose was to carry out a sentiment analysis on the reviews of an Amazon product.
